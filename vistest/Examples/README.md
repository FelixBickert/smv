# Fire and Smoke Demonstration GUI

This directory contains a python gui and associated for demonstrating (using fds and Smokeview) how fire and smoke behave.  This works on Windows, Mac and Linux computers.  The programs fds and smokeview need to be in your path.  To use, type:

```python DEMOfds.py```

on a Linux or Mac computer, type:

```DEMOfds.py```

on a Windows computer. The GUI runs a fds on a one room case.  It gives you options to change the fire size, door size and gravity vector.  You can set up two scenarios and compare the results.
