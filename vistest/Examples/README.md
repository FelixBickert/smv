# Fire and Smoke Demonstration GUI

This directory contains a python gui and associated files used for demonstrating fire and smoke behavior using fds and Smokeview.  This works on Windows, Mac and Linux computers.  The programs fds and smokeview need to be in the path.  To use, type:

```python DEMOfds.py```

on a Linux or Mac computer and

```DEMOfds.py```

on a Windows computer. The GUI allows one to set up, run and compare two one room fds cases.

The GUI gives options for changing fire size, door size and the gravity vector.  Two scenarios can be setup and compared. The `Make input` buttons create the input files.  The `Run` buttons run the case using FDS and the `View` buttons visualize the cases using smokeview.
