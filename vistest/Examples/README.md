# Fire and Smoke Demonstration GUI

This directory contains a python gui and associated for demonstrating (using fds and Smokeview) how fire and smoke behave.  This works on Windows, Mac and Linux computers.  The programs fds and smokeview need to be in your path.  To use, type:

```python DEMOfds.py```

on a Linux or Mac computer, type:

```DEMOfds.py```

on a Windows computer. The GUI allows you to set up and run two fds cases.  Each case is a simple one room case.

You have the option to change the fire size, door size and gravity vector.  You can set up two scenarios and compare the results. The `Make` button creates the input file.  The `Run` button runs the case with FDS and the `View` button visualizes the case with smokeview.
